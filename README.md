# Bacteria-Biodiversity
Javascript, Plotly, D3, BootStrap



## Objective:
The objective is to identify a bacteria species that can be used to manufacture synthetic beef. An interactive dashboard has been designed, coded, and tested to provide demographic information and visualizatons on bacteria found per test subject ID. Users will be able to filter by subject ID and then view the top ten bacteria species found as a horizontal bar chart. A gauge chart displays the weekly washing frequency value for each subject ID. Finally, the dashboard contains a bubble chart that display all the bacteria found per subject ID, the type of bacteria, and the sample value. If the manufactuer identifies a species of bacteria that could be used to make synthetic beef the dashboard will be able to identify which test subject/s it was found in and other important information. 

1. Create webpage with HTML. 
2. Add style with Bootstrap and CSS.
3. Use JavaScript and D3 to build interactive filters.
4. Use Plotly to build bar, gauge, and bubble plots.
